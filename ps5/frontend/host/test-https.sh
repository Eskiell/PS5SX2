# PS5 port frontend: the tests of our HTTPS client (https_test.cpp) on a PC (2026-10-05, AI-assisted). Builds the
# vendored mbedTLS with the port's config, fe_https.cpp and the test with the sanitizers, runs the unit tests, then the
# local servers of https_testserver.py (needs Python's "cryptography"). HTTPS_REAL=1 also fetches from archive.org
# (through $https_proxy's CONNECT when it is set); HTTPS_STATIC_OUT=<file> instead writes a static, sanitizer-free
# binary for another Linux PC (for "https_test real" there).
