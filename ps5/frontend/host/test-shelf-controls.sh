# pr9n (AI-assisted), PR #9 review item 11: the shelf's controls in fe_host (SwiftShader stands in for the GPU).
#   - L1 + Square opens the RetroAchievements account in either order: L1 first used to jump 5 games before the chord
#     was seen (the selection now goes back), Square first used to open the settings sheet and L1 then switched it to
#     This game (the sheet now closes and the account opens);
#   - L1 alone still jumps 5 games;
#   - the sheet's tabs stop at either end (L2 from Settings went round to Achievements, which starts network traffic).
